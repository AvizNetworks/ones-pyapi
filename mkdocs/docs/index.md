# Welcome to Ones-Api
ONES SDK for developers and Network Engineers
### Ones Python SDK
The goal is to create a Python SDK for existing ONES API infrastructure. It helps to connect and perform all actions that are currently performing using API, with the help of functions.

### Usage-
* It can be used by existing ONES users and help to get stats related to their infrastructure.
* People will be able to integrate ONES with other products using ONES-SDK.
* Network Engineers get details related to switches, devices etc using commands.

### Tools and Technologies-
* Python (version 3.9.6)
* Modules - requests (It will help in making HTTP/S calls with API)
* setuputil (for creating python package that will install using pip install and can be used with
 any python codebase)

### Ones_Client-
ones_client is for developers and network engineers to connect and integrate with ONES API's functionality.

* SDK will contain `OnesClient`, that will contain multiple modules, and each module will perform 
  specified tasks. -->

# ONES APIs 

Aviz ONES is the industry's first multi-vendor platform which provides seamless network orchestration and monitoring capabilities. From storing the physical topology, device health, utilization and network events, it also provides network orchestration/automation for the data center fabric deployments. All this fleet-wide data is provided to the network administrators using standardized ONES APIs. ONES Provides a smooth transition for Network Admin for SONiC transition depending on the consumption model.

ONES APIs supports following interfaces
- gNMI (Secured using certificates)
- REST API (Secured using user tokens)
